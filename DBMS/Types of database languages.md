# Types of Database Languages

## Definition
Database languages are specialized languages used to interact with a **Database Management System (DBMS)** (*DBMS*, *RDBMS*) to define, manipulate, control, and query data in a **database** (*Database*, *Database System*). They provide structured commands to manage database schemas, data, and access permissions, enabling efficient communication between users/applications and the database system.

## Types of Database Languages
Database languages are categorized based on their purpose and functionality. The primary types, commonly associated with **Relational DBMS (RDBMS)** (*RDBMS*), are:

1. **Data Definition Language (DDL)**:
   - **Purpose**: Defines and modifies the structure (schema) of database objects (e.g., tables, schemas, indexes).
   - **Characteristics**:
     - Specifies metadata, such as table structures, constraints, and data types (*Database*).
     - Changes are typically permanent and affect the database catalog.
     - Does not manipulate data content but defines how data is organized (*Main Memory and Secondary Memory*).
   - **Commands**:
     - `CREATE`: Defines new objects (e.g., CREATE TABLE).
     - `ALTER`: Modifies existing objects (e.g., ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN).
     - `DROP`: Deletes objects (e.g., DROP TABLE).
     - `TRUNCATE`: Removes all data from a table but retains structure.
   - **Example**: `CREATE TABLE Customers (ID INT PRIMARY KEY, Name VARCHAR(50));`
   - **Relation to Prior Discussions**:
     - Affects database schema stored in secondary memory (*Main Memory and Secondary Memory*).
     - DDL operations may use caching for metadata access (*Cache*, *Direct/Associative Mapping*).
     - Schema changes require exclusive locks to prevent concurrent conflicts (*Semaphore and Mutex*).

2. **Data Manipulation Language (DML)**:
   - **Purpose**: Manipulates data within database objects (e.g., inserting, updating, deleting, or retrieving data).
   - **Characteristics**:
     - Operates on data content, not structure (*Database*).
     - Supports transactional operations, adhering to ACID properties (*RDBMS*, *Deadlock*, *Producer-Consumer Problem*).
     - Frequently cached for performance (*Cache*, *Demand Paging*).
   - **Commands**:
     - `INSERT`: Adds new data (e.g., INSERT INTO Customers VALUES (1, 'Alice')).
     - `UPDATE`: Modifies existing data (e.g., UPDATE Customers SET Name = 'Bob' WHERE ID = 1).
     - `DELETE`: Removes data (e.g., DELETE FROM Customers WHERE ID = 1).
     - `SELECT`: Retrieves data (e.g., SELECT * FROM Customers).
   - **Example**: `SELECT Name FROM Customers WHERE ID = 1;`
   - **Relation to Prior Discussions**:
     - DML queries are executed by DBMS processes/threads (*Processes and Threads*, *Multitasking and Multiprocessing*).
     - Query execution uses scheduling (*Priority Scheduling*, *Round Robin Scheduling*).
     - Concurrent DML operations risk deadlocks, managed by locking (*Semaphore and Mutex*, *Banker’s Algorithm*).

3. **Data Control Language (DCL)**:
   - **Purpose**: Manages access permissions and security policies for database objects.
   - **Characteristics**:
     - Defines user roles, privileges, and access controls to ensure data security (*DBMS*, *RDBMS*).
     - Controls who can perform DDL/DML operations.
     - Affects metadata related to user privileges (*Main Memory and Secondary Memory*).
   - **Commands**:
     - `GRANT`: Assigns permissions (e.g., GRANT SELECT ON Customers TO User1).
     - `REVOKE`: Removes permissions (e.g., REVOKE SELECT ON Customers FROM User1).
   - **Example**: `GRANT INSERT, UPDATE ON Customers TO Admin;`
   - **Relation to Prior Discussions**:
     - DCL operations ensure secure concurrent access (*Semaphore and Mutex*).
     - Security metadata may be cached for fast access (*Cache*).
     - Relates to transaction isolation in concurrent environments (*Producer-Consumer Problem*).

4. **Transaction Control Language (TCL)**:
   - **Purpose**: Manages transactions to ensure data integrity and consistency during DML operations.
   - **Characteristics**:
     - Controls transaction boundaries, ensuring ACID compliance (*RDBMS*).
     - Used to commit or rollback changes, especially in concurrent systems (*Deadlock*, *Processes and Threads*).
     - Impacts transaction logs stored in secondary memory (*Main Memory and Secondary Memory*).
   - **Commands**:
     - `COMMIT`: Saves all changes in a transaction permanently.
     - `ROLLBACK`: Undoes changes since the last commit.
     - `SAVEPOINT`: Sets a point within a transaction for partial rollback.
     - `SET TRANSACTION`: Defines transaction properties (e.g., read-only).
   - **Example**: `BEGIN TRANSACTION; INSERT INTO Customers VALUES (2, 'Charlie'); COMMIT;`
   - **Relation to Prior Discussions**:
     - TCL ensures atomicity and durability, mitigating deadlocks (*Deadlock*, *Banker’s Algorithm*).
     - Transaction logs reduce thrashing by buffering writes (*Thrashing*, *Demand Paging*).
     - Concurrent transactions use synchronization (*Semaphore and Mutex*, *Producer-Consumer Problem*).

5. **Data Query Language (DQL)** (Optional/Subcategory):
   - **Purpose**: Retrieves data from the database, often considered a subset of DML.
   - **Characteristics**:
     - Focuses exclusively on querying (read-only operations).
     - Optimizes performance via indexing and caching (*Cache*, *Direct/Associative Mapping*).
     - Does not modify data or structure.
   - **Command**:
     - `SELECT`: Retrieves specific data (e.g., SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE Name = 'Alice').
   - **Example**: `SELECT ID, Name FROM Customers ORDER BY Name;`
   - **Note**: Some classifications merge DQL with DML, as `SELECT` is a DML command in SQL standards.
   - **Relation to Prior Discussions**:
     - DQL queries leverage OS paging and caching (*Virtual Memory*, *Paging*, *Cache*).
     - Query execution may be prioritized (*Priority Scheduling*).
     - Read-only queries avoid deadlocks but require concurrency control (*Semaphore and Mutex*).

### Additional Notes
- **Non-SQL Languages**:
  - In **NoSQL databases** (*DBMS*), languages vary:
    - **MongoDB**: Uses JSON-like queries (e.g., `db.customers.find({"name": "Alice"})`).
    - **Cassandra**: Uses CQL (Cassandra Query Language), similar to SQL.
    - **Neo4j**: Uses Cypher for graph databases (e.g., `MATCH (c:Customer) RETURN c.name`).
  - These are analogous to SQL’s DDL/DML/DCL/TCL but tailored to non-relational models (*Database*).
- **Performance**:
  - Query execution speed depends on indexing, caching, and disk latency (e.g., NVMe SSDs in 2025, *Main Memory and Secondary Memory*).
  - Concurrent query execution introduces overhead (*Semaphore and Mutex*, *Multitasking and Multiprocessing*).
- **Implementation**:
  - SQL is the standard for RDBMS (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle).
  - NoSQL databases use proprietary or domain-specific languages (*DBMS*).
  - Database languages interact with DBMS processes, leveraging OS resources (*Processes and Threads*).
- **Modern Context**:
  - In 2025, SQL remains dominant for RDBMS, with extensions for JSON/XML handling (e.g., PostgreSQL JSONB).
  - NoSQL query languages gain traction for cloud and big data (e.g., AWS DynamoDB, MongoDB).
  - AI-driven databases (e.g., vector databases) introduce specialized query syntax for embeddings.

### Example
- **Scenario**: A university database in PostgreSQL (*RDBMS*).
  - **DDL**: `CREATE TABLE Students (ID INT PRIMARY KEY, Name VARCHAR(50));`
  - **DML**: `INSERT INTO Students VALUES (1, 'Alice'); SELECT * FROM Students;`
  - **DCL**: `GRANT SELECT ON Students TO Faculty;`
  - **TCL**: `BEGIN TRANSACTION; UPDATE Students SET Name = 'Bob' WHERE ID = 1; COMMIT;`
  - **Context**: Commands execute concurrently (*Multitasking and Multiprocessing*), with caching for performance (*Cache*).
