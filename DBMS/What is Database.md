# Database

## Definition
A **database** is an organized, structured collection of data, typically stored and accessed electronically from a computer system, designed to facilitate efficient storage, retrieval, management, and manipulation of data. It is managed by a **Database Management System (DBMS)** (*DBMS*), which provides an interface for users and applications to interact with the data.

### Technical Characteristics
- **Structure**:
  - Data is stored in a systematic format, such as **tables** in relational databases, **documents** in NoSQL databases, or **graphs** in graph databases.
  - Organized to support relationships (e.g., primary keys, foreign keys in RDBMS) and indexing for fast access (*Cache*).
  - Resides primarily in **secondary memory** (e.g., SSDs, HDDs, *Main Memory and Secondary Memory*), with frequently accessed data cached in **main memory** (*Cache*, *Demand Paging*).
- **Purpose**:
  - Enables efficient data storage, querying (e.g., SQL), updating, and deletion.
  - Supports **data integrity**, consistency, and **security** through constraints, transactions, and access controls (*Semaphore and Mutex*, *Producer-Consumer Problem*).
  - Facilitates ** concurrent access** by multiple users or processes (*Processes and Threads*, *Multitasking and Multiprocessing*).
- **Components**:
  - **Data**: Raw facts (e.g., customer names, transactions).
  - **Schema**: Defines the structure and constraints (e.g., table definitions, data types).
  - **Metadata**: Data about data (e.g., table structure, indexes), stored in the database catalog.
  - **Indexes**: Data structures to optimize query performance (*Cache*, *Direct/Associative Mapping*).
- **Types**:
  - **Relational Database**: Data in tables with relationships (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
  - **NoSQL Database**: Handles unstructured/semi-structured data (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra for document, key-value, or graph).
  - **Object-Oriented Database**: Combines data with object-oriented principles (e.g., db4o).
  - **Hierarchical/Network Database**: Older models with tree or graph-like structures (e.g., IMS).
  - **Time-Series Database**: Optimized for time-stamped data (e.g., InfluxDB for IoT).
- **Implementation**:
  - Stored on **non-volatile secondary memory** (e.g., NVMe SSDs for low latency, *Main Memory and Secondary Memory*).
  - Managed by DBMS processes, leveraging OS features like ** multitasking** and **multiprocessing** for query execution (*Multitasking and Multiprocessing*).
  - Uses ** virtual memory** and **paging** for data access, with page caching to reduce disk I/O (*Virtual Memory*, *Paging*, *Demand Paging*).
  - Employs **scheduling** algorithms for query prioritization (e.g., *Priority Scheduling*, *FCFS Scheduling*).

## Why Needed
- **Organized Data Storage**: Provides a structured repository for large volumes of data, minimizing redundancy (*Normalization*).
- **Efficient Data Access**: Supports fast retrieval via queries, critical for applications like banking, e-commerce, or analytics (*Cache*).
- **Data Sharing**: Enables multiple users/applications to access data concurrently, supporting collaboration (*Processes and Threads*).
- **Data Integrity and Security**: Enforces constraints and access controls to ensure reliable and secure data (*Semaphore and Mutex*).
- **Scalability**: Handles growing data volumes and user loads, especially in distributed databases (*Multitasking and Multiprocessing*).
- **Applications**: Essential for business (e.g., CRM, ERP), science (e.g., bioinformatics), and real-time systems (e.g., IoT, *Real-Time Operating System*).

### Technical Notes
- **Relation to Prior Discussions**:
  - **DBMS** (*DBMS*): A database is the data store managed by a DBMS, which provides the interface and logic for data operations.
  - **Main Memory and Secondary Memory** (*Main Memory and Secondary Memory*): Databases reside in secondary memory, with main memory used for caching and indexing (*Cache*, *Direct/Associative Mapping*).
  - **Virtual Memory/Paging/Demand Paging** (*Virtual Memory*, *Paging*, *Demand Paging*): Databases rely on OS paging, risking ** thrashing** (*Trashing*) with large datasets (*Fragmentation*).
  - **Fragmentation** (*Fragmentation*): Data organization minimizes storage fragmentation, but large tables may cause internal fragmentation.
  - **Processes/Threads** (*Processes and Threads*): Database queries are handled by DBMS processes/threads, requiring concurrent execution (*Multitasking and Multiprocessing*).
  - **Semaphore and Mutex** (*Semaphore and Mutex*): Used for transaction locking to ensure isolation and consistency (*Producer-Consumer Problem*).
  - **Deadlock** (*Deadlock*, *Banker’s Algorithm*): Concurrent transactions risk deadlocks, mitigated by detection or timeouts.
  - **Starvation** (*Starvation and Aging*): Long transactions may starve others, addressed via priority scheduling (*Priority Scheduling*).
  - **Spooling** (*Spooling*): Query queues in databases resemble spooling for I/O tasks (*Producer-Consumer Problem*).
  - **Real-Time Operating System** (*Real-Time Operating System*): Real-time databases ensure deterministic responses (e.g., for autonomous vehicles).
  - **Dynamic Binding** (*Dynamic Binding*): Databases support dynamic query execution for flexibility.
  - **Scheduling (FCFS, SJF, SRTF, LRTF, Priority, Round Robin)** (*FCFS Scheduling*, *SJF Scheduling*, *SRTF Scheduling*, *LRTF Scheduling*, *Priority Scheduling*, *Round Robin Scheduling*): Query execution uses scheduling to optimize performance.
  - **Producer-Consumer Problem** (*Producer-Consumer Problem*): Database buffer management mirrors producer-consumer synchronization.
  - **Banker’s Algorithm** (*Banker’s Algorithm*): Resource allocation for database transactions may apply to avoid deadlocks.
  - **Cache** (*Cache*, *Direct/Associative Mapping*): Databases cache data/indexes to reduce disk access, improving performance.
  - **Multitasking/Multiprocessing** (*Multitasking and Multiprocessing*): DBMS leverages multitasking for query concurrency and multiprocessing for parallel query execution.
- **Performance**:
  - Query speed depends on indexing, caching, and disk latency (e.g., NVMe SSDs in 2025 reduce I/O time, *Main Memory and Secondary Memory*).
  - Concurrency overhead (e.g., locking) impacts performance (*Semaphore and Mutex*).
- **Implementation**:
  - Managed by DBMS software (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB).
  - Deployed on OSs like Linux/Windows, using file systems for storage (*Main Memory and Secondary Memory*).
- **Modern Context**:
  - In 2025, databases are critical for cloud (e.g., AWS Aurora), AI (e.g., vector databases for embeddings), and IoT (e.g., time-series for sensor data).
  - Distributed databases (e.g., Google Spanner, CockroachDB) dominate for scalability.

### Example
- **Scenario**: An e-commerce platform uses a relational database (e.g., MySQL).
  - **Database Role**: Stores customer profiles, product listings, and orders in tables.
  - **Functionality**: Supports SQL queries for product searches, transaction processing, and inventory updates, with indexes for fast access (*Cache*).
