# Indexing in DBMS

## Definition
**Indexing** in a **Database Management System (DBMS)** (*DBMS*, *RDBMS*) is a data structure technique used to optimize the retrieval of records from a **database** (*Database*, *Database System*) by creating a separate structure (index) that maps values of specific attributes to their corresponding records. Indexes enhance query performance, particularly for **Data Manipulation Language (DML)** operations like `SELECT`, at the cost of additional storage and maintenance overhead (*Database Languages*).

### Purpose
- **Performance Optimization**: Reduces query execution time by minimizing disk I/O for searches, filters, and joins (*Cache*, *Main Memory and Secondary Memory*).
- **Efficient Data Access**: Supports rapid lookup of records based on indexed attributes (*Keys in DBMS*).
- **Scalability**: Improves performance in large datasets, including distributed systems (*Sharding*, *Vertical and Horizontal Scaling*).
- **Data Integrity**: Often used with **primary keys** and **unique keys** to enforce uniqueness (*ACID Properties*, *Keys in DBMS*).

## Characteristics
- **Structure**: Indexes are typically implemented as **B-trees**, **B+-trees**, **hash tables**, or other data structures, stored in secondary memory and cached in main memory (*Main Memory and Secondary Memory*, *Cache*).
- **Attributes Indexed**: Usually applied to frequently queried columns (e.g., primary keys, foreign keys, or search fields, *Keys in DBMS*).
- **Types**:
  - **Clustered Index**: Determines the physical order of data in a table; only one per table (e.g., primary key index).
  - **Non-Clustered Index**: Separate structure pointing to data; multiple per table.
- **Overhead**: Increases storage requirements and slows **INSERT**, **UPDATE**, and **DELETE** operations due to index maintenance (*Database Languages*).
- **Concurrency**: Index updates require locks, risking contention (*Semaphore and Mutex*, *Producer-Consumer Problem*).

## Types of Indexes
1. **Clustered Index**:
   - **Definition**: An index that dictates the physical storage order of table data, aligning records with the index structure.
   - **Characteristics**:
     - Only one clustered index per table, as data can be physically sorted in one way.
     - Typically created on the **primary key** (*Keys in DBMS*).
     - Enhances range queries (e.g., `SELECT * WHERE ID BETWEEN 100 AND 200`) due to sequential storage.
   - **Example**: A `Students` table with a clustered index on `StudentID`, storing rows in `StudentID` order on disk (*Main Memory and Secondary Memory*).
   - **Relation to Prior Discussions**: Improves query performance (*Cache*), defined via **DDL** (*Database Languages*).

2. **Non-Clustered Index**:
   - **Definition**: An index that stores a separate structure with pointers to the actual data, leaving the table’s physical order unchanged.
   - **Characteristics**:
     - Multiple non-clustered indexes can exist per table.
     - Created on frequently queried columns (e.g., **foreign keys**, search fields, *Keys in DBMS*).
     - Requires additional storage for the index structure.
   - **Example**: A non-clustered index on `Name` in a `Students` table, mapping names to row locations.
   - **Relation to Prior Discussions**: Increases storage but speeds up DML queries (*Cache*, *Database Languages*).

3. **Unique Index**:
   - **Definition**: An index that enforces uniqueness for the indexed column(s), preventing duplicate values.
   - **Characteristics**:
     - Often used with **primary keys** or **unique keys** (*Keys in DBMS*).
     - Can be clustered or non-clustered.
     - Ensures **data integrity** (*ACID Properties*).
   - **Example**: A unique index on `Email` in a `Users` table to ensure no duplicate emails.
   - **Relation to Prior Discussions**: Enforces consistency (*ACID Properties*), impacts concurrent updates (*Semaphore and Mutex*).

4. **Composite Index (Multi-Column Index)**:
   - **Definition**: An index on two or more columns, used for queries involving multiple attributes.
   - **Characteristics**:
     - Improves performance for queries with combined conditions (e.g., `WHERE City = 'Paris' AND Age > 30`).
     - Order of columns in the index matters for query optimization.
     - Can be clustered or non-clustered.
   - **Example**: A composite index on `{LastName, FirstName}` in a `Customers` table.
   - **Relation to Prior Discussions**: Supports complex queries (*Database Languages*), used in sharding (*Sharding*).

5. **Bitmap Index**:
   - **Definition**: An index using bitmaps to represent the presence of values, ideal for columns with low cardinality (few distinct values).
   - **Characteristics**:
     - Efficient for queries on categorical data (e.g., gender, status).
     - Compact storage but less effective for high-cardinality columns.
   - **Example**: A bitmap index on `Gender` in a `Employees` table, with bitmaps for ‘Male’ and ‘Female’.
   - **Relation to Prior Discussions**: Optimizes analytical queries (*Cache*), less common in transactional systems (*ACID Properties*).

6. **Full-Text Index**:
   - **Definition**: An index designed for efficient searching of text data in large columns (e.g., articles, descriptions).
   - **Characteristics**:
     - Supports keyword searches, phrase matching, and ranking.
     - Common in search-intensive applications (e.g., e-commerce).
   - **Example**: A full-text index on `Description` in a `Products` table for searching product details.
   - **Relation to Prior Discussions**: Enhances DML search queries (*Database Languages*), cached for speed (*Cache*).

7. **Hash Index**:
   - **Definition**: An index using a hash table for exact-match queries, mapping values to record locations.
   - **Characteristics**:
     - Fast for equality searches (e.g., `WHERE ID = 100`) but inefficient for range queries.
     - Less common in modern RDBMS, used in specific NoSQL systems (*DBMS*).
   - **Example**: A hash index on `UserID` in a `Sessions` table for quick lookups.
   - **Relation to Prior Discussions**: Aligns with hash-based sharding (*Sharding*), cached for performance (*Cache*).

### Technical Notes
- **Implementation**:
  - Defined using **Data Definition Language (DDL)** (e.g., `CREATE INDEX`, *Database Languages*).
  - Stored in secondary memory, with frequent access cached in main memory (*Main Memory and Secondary Memory*, *Cache*).
  - Maintained by the DBMS storage manager, updated during **INSERT**, **UPDATE**, and **DELETE** (*DBMS*).
  - Concurrent index updates use locks (*Semaphore and Mutex*, *Producer-Consumer Problem*).
- **Performance**:
  - Speeds up **SELECT** queries by reducing disk I/O, leveraging B-trees or hash tables (*Cache*, *Direct/Associative Mapping*).
  - Slows down write operations (e.g., **INSERT**, **UPDATE**) due to index updates (*Database Languages*).
  - NVMe SSDs in 2025 reduce index access latency (*Main Memory and Secondary Memory*).
  - Large indexes risk **thrashing** in memory-constrained systems (*Thrashing*, *Virtual Memory*, *Demand Paging*).
- **Relation to Prior Discussions**:
  - **Database/DBMS/RDBMS/Database System** (*Database*, *DBMS*, *RDBMS*, *Database System*): Indexing is a core DBMS optimization technique.
  - **Keys in DBMS** (*Keys in DBMS*): Primary/unique keys often have implicit indexes; foreign keys may be indexed.
  - **Types of Relationships** (*Types of Relationships*): Indexes on foreign keys speed up joins.
  - **ACID Properties** (*ACID Properties*): Unique indexes enforce consistency.
  - **Database Languages** (*Database Languages*): DDL creates indexes; DML benefits from them.
  - **Vertical and Horizontal Scaling** (*Vertical and Horizontal Scaling*): Indexes improve single-node performance (vertical) but complicate sharding (horizontal, *Sharding*).
  - **Data Abstraction** (*Data Abstraction in DBMS*): Indexes are managed at the physical level, hidden from logical/view levels.
  - **Main Memory and Secondary Memory** (*Main Memory and Secondary Memory*): Indexes reside in secondary memory, cached for speed (*Cache*).
  - **Cache** (*Cache*, *Direct/Associative Mapping*): Indexes are critical for cache efficiency.
  - **Virtual Memory/Paging/Demand Paging** (*Virtual Memory*, *Paging*, *Demand Paging*): Large indexes increase paging overhead (*Fragmentation*).
  - **Processes/Threads** (*Processes and Threads*): DBMS threads manage index operations (*Multitasking and Multiprocessing*).
  - **Semaphore and Mutex** (*Semaphore and Mutex*): Locks ensure concurrent index integrity (*Producer-Consumer Problem*).
  - **Deadlock** (*Deadlock*, *Banker’s Algorithm*): Index updates risk deadlocks in transactions.
  - **Starvation** (*Starvation and Aging*): Long index rebuilds may starve queries (*Priority Scheduling*).
  - **Spooling** (*Spooling*): Index query queues resemble spooling (*Producer-Consumer Problem*).
  - **Real-Time Operating System** (*Real-Time Operating System*): Indexes ensure fast access in real-time DBMS.
  - **Dynamic Binding** (*Dynamic Binding*): Dynamic SQL queries leverage indexes.
  - **Scheduling** (*FCFS Scheduling*, *SJF Scheduling*, *SRTF Scheduling*, *LRTF Scheduling*, *Priority Scheduling*, *Round Robin Scheduling*): Index queries use scheduling for fairness.
- **Modern Context**:
  - In 2025, indexing is critical for RDBMS (e.g., PostgreSQL, Oracle) and NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB, DynamoDB) in cloud environments (e.g., AWS RDS).
  - Advanced indexing techniques (e.g., GiST, GIN in PostgreSQL) support spatial and full-text searches.
  - Distributed databases (e.g., CockroachDB) use indexes with sharding (*Sharding*).

### Example
- **Scenario**: An e-commerce database in MySQL (*RDBMS*).
  - **Clustered Index**: On `ProductID` (primary key) in `Products` table, ordering data physically (*Keys in DBMS*).
  - **Non-Clustered Index**: On `CategoryID` (foreign key) in `Products` for fast category searches (*Types of Relationships*).
  - **Unique Index**: On `SKU` in `Products` to prevent duplicate stock codes (*ACID Properties*).
  - **Composite Index**: On `{CustomerID, OrderDate}` in `Orders` for customer history queries.
  - **Context**: Indexes speed up `SELECT` queries (*Database Languages*), cached for efficiency (*Cache*), but complicate sharding (*Sharding*).
