# ACID Properties

## Definition
The **ACID properties** are a set of four fundamental guarantees provided by a **Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)** (*RDBMS*, *DBMS*) to ensure reliable and consistent transaction processing in a **database** (*Database*, *Database System*). ACID stands for **Atomicity**, **Consistency**, **Isolation**, and **Durability**, and these properties are critical for maintaining data integrity in concurrent and fault-prone environments.

## ACID Properties

1. **Atomicity**:
   - **Definition**: Ensures that a transaction is treated as a single, indivisible unit of work—either all operations in the transaction are completed successfully, or none of them are applied.
   - **Mechanism**:
     - If a transaction fails (e.g., due to a crash or constraint violation), the DBMS rolls back all changes using transaction logs (*Main Memory and Secondary Memory*).
     - Implemented via **Transaction Control Language (TCL)** commands like `COMMIT` and `ROLLBACK` (*Database Languages*).
   - **Example**: In a bank transfer, debit from account A and credit to account B are both executed or neither is, preventing partial updates.
   - **Relation to Prior Discussions**:
     - Prevents partial states in concurrent systems (*Processes and Threads*, *Multitasking and Multiprocessing*).
     - Relies on logging to avoid data loss (*Main Memory and Secondary Memory*).
     - Mitigates issues like deadlocks during transaction rollback (*Deadlock*, *Banker’s Algorithm*).

2. **Consistency**:
   - **Definition**: Guarantees that a transaction brings the database from one valid state to another, maintaining all predefined rules, constraints, and data integrity (e.g., primary keys, foreign keys, check constraints).
   - **Mechanism**:
     - The DBMS enforces constraints (e.g., uniqueness, referential integrity) before committing a transaction (*RDBMS*).
     - Ensures data adheres to schema definitions and business rules (*Database*).
   - **Example**: A transaction adding an order must reference an existing customer (foreign key constraint), or it fails, preserving referential integrity.
   - **Relation to Prior Discussions**:
     - Enforced via **Data Definition Language (DDL)** constraints (*Database Languages*).
     - Prevents data corruption in concurrent access (*Semaphore and Mutex*, *Producer-Consumer Problem*).
     - May cause transaction aborts, risking starvation (*Starvation and Aging*).

3. **Isolation**:
   - **Definition**: Ensures that transactions are executed in isolation from one another, preventing interference even when executed concurrently, so partial changes from one transaction are not visible to others until completion.
   - **Mechanism**:
     - Achieved through concurrency control techniques like locking (e.g., two-phase locking) or versioning (e.g., multiversion concurrency control, MVCC) (*Semaphore and Mutex*).
     - Isolation levels (e.g., Read Uncommitted, Serializable) balance consistency and performance (*RDBMS*).
   - **Example**: If two transactions update the same account balance simultaneously, one waits until the other commits, avoiding inconsistent reads.
   - **Relation to Prior Discussions**:
     - Critical for concurrent query execution (*Multitasking and Multiprocessing*, *Producer-Consumer Problem*).
     - Uses locks, risking deadlocks or starvation (*Deadlock*, *Starvation and Aging*, *Banker’s Algorithm*).
     - Leverages scheduling for transaction prioritization (*Priority Scheduling*, *Round Robin Scheduling*).

4. **Durability**:
   - **Definition**: Guarantees that once a transaction is committed, its changes are permanently saved to the database, even in the event of a system failure (e.g., power outage).
   - **Mechanism**:
     - The DBMS writes committed changes to non-volatile storage (e.g., SSDs) using transaction logs before confirming the commit (*Main Memory and Secondary Memory*).
     - Recovery mechanisms restore committed transactions after crashes (*DBMS*).
   - **Example**: After a bank transfer is committed, the updated balances are saved to disk, surviving a server crash.
   - **Relation to Prior Discussions**:
     - Relies on secondary memory for persistent storage (*Main Memory and Secondary Memory*).
     - Uses caching for log writes, reducing latency (*Cache*, *Direct/Associative Mapping*).
     - Recovery avoids thrashing during crash recovery (*Thrashing*, *Demand Paging*).

### Technical Notes
- **Purpose**:
  - Ensures reliable transaction processing in multi-user, fault-prone environments (*Database System*).
  - Critical for applications requiring data integrity (e.g., banking, e-commerce, healthcare).
- **Implementation**:
  - Managed by the DBMS transaction manager (*DBMS*, *RDBMS*).
  - Uses transaction logs, locks, and recovery protocols (*Semaphore and Mutex*).
  - Supported by SQL **TCL** commands (e.g., `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, *Database Languages*).
- **Relation to Prior Discussions**:
  - **Database/DBMS/RDBMS/Database System** (*Database*, *DBMS*, *RDBMS*, *Database System*): ACID is a core property of RDBMS, ensuring reliable data management.
  - **Main Memory and Secondary Memory** (*Main Memory and Secondary Memory*): Durability relies on secondary memory; caching optimizes performance (*Cache*).
  - **Cache** (*Cache*, *Direct/Associative Mapping*): Transaction logs and data are cached for speed, impacting ACID efficiency.
  - **Virtual Memory/Paging/Demand Paging** (*Virtual Memory*, *Paging*, *Demand Paging*): Large transactions risk thrashing (*Thrashing*, *Fragmentation*).
  - **Processes/Threads** (*Processes and Threads*): Transactions are executed by DBMS threads, requiring concurrency control (*Multitasking and Multiprocessing*).
  - **Semaphore and Mutex** (*Semaphore and Mutex*): Locks ensure isolation and atomicity, mirroring producer-consumer synchronization (*Producer-Consumer Problem*).
  - **Deadlock** (*Deadlock*, *Banker’s Algorithm*): Isolation via locks risks deadlocks, mitigated by detection or timeouts.
  - **Starvation** (*Starvation and Aging*): Long transactions may starve others, addressed via scheduling (*Priority Scheduling*).
  - **Spooling** (*Spooling*): Transaction queues resemble spooling for I/O-bound tasks (*Producer-Consumer Problem*).
  - **Real-Time Operating System** (*Real-Time Operating System*): Real-time RDBMS ensures ACID with deterministic timing.
  - **Dynamic Binding** (*Dynamic Binding*): Dynamic SQL transactions support ACID compliance.
  - **Scheduling** (*FCFS Scheduling*, *SJF Scheduling*, *SRTF Scheduling*, *LRTF Scheduling*, *Priority Scheduling*, *Round Robin Scheduling*): Transaction execution uses scheduling for fairness and performance.
  - **Producer-Consumer Problem** (*Producer-Consumer Problem*): Transaction buffers mirror producer-consumer patterns.
  - **Banker’s Algorithm** (*Banker’s Algorithm*): Resource allocation for transactions avoids deadlocks, supporting ACID.
- **Performance**:
  - ACID compliance introduces overhead (e.g., locking, logging), mitigated by caching and fast storage (e.g., NVMe SSDs in 2025, *Main Memory and Secondary Memory*).
  - Isolation levels trade off consistency for performance (*Semaphore and Mutex*).
- **Modern Context**:
  - In 2025, ACID remains critical for RDBMS (e.g., PostgreSQL, Oracle) in enterprises and cloud platforms (e.g., AWS RDS).
  - NoSQL databases (*DBMS*) often relax ACID (e.g., eventual consistency in Cassandra) for scalability, but some (e.g., MongoDB) offer ACID for specific workloads.

### Example
- **Scenario**: An online store uses MySQL (*RDBMS*) for order processing.
  - **Atomicity**: A transaction updating inventory and recording a sale either completes fully or rolls back if stock is insufficient.
  - **Consistency**: Ensures the inventory cannot go negative (CHECK constraint).
  - **Isolation**: Two simultaneous orders for the same item are serialized via locks (*Semaphore and Mutex*).
  - **Durability**: Committed orders are saved to SSD, surviving a crash (*Main Memory and Secondary Memory*).
