# Sharding

## Definition
**Sharding** is a database architecture technique used to partition a large **database** (*Database*, *Database System*) into smaller, more manageable pieces called **shards**, each stored on separate servers or nodes. It is a form of **horizontal scaling** (*Vertical and Horizontal Scaling*) that distributes data across multiple machines to improve performance, scalability, and manageability, particularly in distributed **DBMS** (*DBMS*, *RDBMS*) or NoSQL systems.

### Technical Characteristics
- **Purpose**:
  - Enhances scalability by distributing data and query load across multiple nodes (*Multitasking and Multiprocessing*).
  - Reduces the size of data managed by each server, improving query performance (*Cache*).
  - Supports large-scale applications (e.g., social media, e-commerce) with high data volumes and user concurrency.
- **Mechanism**:
  - Data is partitioned based on a **shard key**, a specific attribute (e.g., user ID, region) that determines which shard stores a given record.
  - Each shard contains a subset of the database’s data, independent of other shards.
  - Queries are routed to the appropriate shard(s) based on the shard key, often using a **query router** or load balancer (*Round Robin Scheduling*).
  - Shards may be replicated for fault tolerance, combining sharding with replication (*Database System*).
- **Types of Sharding**:
  - **Range-Based Sharding**: Partitions data by ranges of the shard key (e.g., user IDs 1–1000 in shard 1, 1001–2000 in shard 2).
  - **Hash-Based Sharding**: Applies a hash function to the shard key for even distribution (e.g., hash(user ID) mod number_of_shards).
  - **Directory-Based Sharding**: Uses a lookup table to map shard keys to shards, offering flexibility but adding overhead.
  - **Geographical Sharding**: Partitions data by geographic location (e.g., EU users in one shard, US users in another).
- **Implementation**:
  - Common in NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra) and distributed RDBMS (e.g., Google Spanner, CockroachDB) (*DBMS*, *RDBMS*).
  - Shards reside on separate nodes, leveraging secondary memory (e.g., SSDs, *Main Memory and Secondary Memory*).
  - Uses caching for frequent queries (*Cache*, *Direct/Associative Mapping*).
  - Requires synchronization for distributed transactions (*Semaphore and Mutex*, *Producer-Consumer Problem*).

### Why Needed
- **Scalability**: Handles massive datasets and high query volumes by distributing load across nodes (*Vertical and Horizontal Scaling*).
- **Performance**: Reduces query latency by limiting data scanned per node (*Cache*, *Demand Paging*).
- **Fault Tolerance**: Isolates failures to specific shards, improving system resilience (*Database System*).
- **Manageability**: Simplifies maintenance by breaking large databases into smaller, independent units.
- **Applications**: Essential for cloud-native systems, big data, and high-traffic applications (e.g., IoT, social networks).

### Advantages
- Enables near-linear scalability by adding more shards/nodes (*Multitasking and Multiprocessing*).
- Improves query performance for shard-specific operations (*Cache*).
- Enhances fault tolerance, as failures affect only specific shards.
- Supports geographic distribution for low-latency access (e.g., GDPR-compliant EU shards).
- Cost-effective, using commodity hardware (*Vertical and Horizontal Scaling*).

### Disadvantages
- **Complexity**: Requires careful shard key selection, query routing, and data distribution (*Semaphore and Mutex*).
- **Data Skew**: Poor shard key choice can lead to uneven data/load distribution (e.g., hotspot shards).
- **Consistency Challenges**: Distributed transactions may relax **ACID properties** (*ACID Properties*), risking eventual consistency in NoSQL (*Producer-Consumer Problem*).
- **Join Operations**: Cross-shard joins are inefficient or unsupported, requiring application-level logic (*Database Languages*).
- **Overhead**: Adds latency for distributed queries and maintenance (e.g., rebalancing shards) (*Main Memory and Secondary Memory*).
- **Deadlock/Starvation Risk**: Distributed transactions increase **deadlock** and **starvation** risks (*Deadlock*, *Starvation and Aging*, *Banker’s Algorithm*).

### Technical Notes
- **Relation to Prior Discussions**:
  - **Database/DBMS/RDBMS/Database System** (*Database*, *DBMS*, *RDBMS*, *Database System*): Sharding is a horizontal scaling strategy for large databases managed by DBMS.
  - **Vertical and Horizontal Scaling** (*Vertical and Horizontal Scaling*): Sharding is a core technique for horizontal scaling, distributing data across nodes.
  - **ACID Properties** (*ACID Properties*): Sharding may weaken consistency/isolation in NoSQL, though some RDBMS (e.g., CockroachDB) maintain ACID.
  - **Database Languages** (*Database Languages*): Sharding impacts query execution (e.g., SQL SELECT must target specific shards).
  - **Main Memory and Secondary Memory** (*Main Memory and Secondary Memory*): Shards are stored in secondary memory, with caching for performance (*Cache*).
  - **Cache** (*Cache*, *Direct/Associative Mapping*): Each shard node uses caching, but cross-shard queries may increase miss rates.
  - **Virtual Memory/Paging/Demand Paging** (*Virtual Memory*, *Paging*, *Demand Paging*): Sharding reduces per-node memory load, mitigating **thrashing** (*Thrashing*, *Fragmentation*).
  - **Processes/Threads** (*Processes and Threads*): Each shard node runs DBMS processes/threads (*Multitasking and Multiprocessing*).
  - **Semaphore and Mutex** (*Semaphore and Mutex*): Synchronization ensures consistency across shards (*Producer-Consumer Problem*).
  - **Deadlock** (*Deadlock*, *Banker’s Algorithm*): Distributed transactions risk deadlocks, requiring detection or timeouts.
  - **Starvation** (*Starvation and Aging*): Uneven shard load may starve nodes, mitigated by load balancing (*Priority Scheduling*).
  - **Spooling** (*Spooling*): Query routing to shards resembles spooling (*Producer-Consumer Problem*).
  - **Real-Time Operating System** (*Real-Time Operating System*): Sharding is less common in RTOS due to latency concerns, but used in distributed RTDBMS.
  - **Dynamic Binding** (*Dynamic Binding*): Sharding supports dynamic node addition for scalability.
  - **Scheduling** (*FCFS Scheduling*, *SJF Scheduling*, *SRTF Scheduling*, *LRTF Scheduling*, *Priority Scheduling*, *Round Robin Scheduling*): Load balancing across shards uses scheduling-like mechanisms (*Round Robin Scheduling*).
- **Performance**:
  - Query speed depends on shard key efficiency, caching, and disk latency (e.g., NVMe SSDs in 2025, *Main Memory and Secondary Memory*).
  - Cross-shard queries introduce network latency, mitigated by proper sharding design (*Cache*).
- **Implementation**:
  - **NoSQL**: MongoDB (hash/range sharding), Cassandra (consistent hashing).
  - **RDBMS**: Google Spanner (range sharding), CockroachDB (distributed SQL).
  - **Cloud**: AWS DynamoDB, Azure Cosmos DB use sharding for scalability.
- **Modern Context**:
  - In 2025, sharding is critical for cloud-native databases (e.g., AWS Aurora, Google Cloud Spanner) and big data platforms (e.g., Snowflake).
  - Widely used in microservices architectures and IoT for distributed data processing.

### Example
- **Scenario**: A social media platform uses MongoDB (*DBMS*) with sharding to store user posts.
  - **Sharding Setup**: User posts are sharded by `user_id` (hash-based), with shard 1 storing users 1–1000, shard 2 for 1001–2000, etc.
  - **Operation**: A query for a user’s posts (e.g., `db.posts.find({user_id: 1500})`) is routed to shard 2, improving performance (*Cache*).
  - **Context**: Sharding enables horizontal scaling (*Vertical and Horizontal Scaling*), but cross-shard analytics (e.g., trending posts) require application logic (*Database Languages*).
