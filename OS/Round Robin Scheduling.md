# Round Robin (RR) Scheduling

## Definition
Round Robin (RR) Scheduling is a preemptive CPU scheduling algorithm in operating systems that allocates the CPU to each process in the ready queue for a fixed time slice, called a **time quantum** (or time slice), in a cyclic order. Processes are executed in a first-come, first-serve (FCFS) manner within the queue, with preemption if they exceed the time quantum.

### Technical Characteristics
- **Mechanism**:
  - Processes are queued in a circular ready queue, processed in arrival order.
  - Each process receives the CPU for a fixed time quantum (e.g., 10ms).
  - If a process completes within the quantum, it terminates; otherwise, it is preempted and returned to the end of the ready queue.
  - The scheduler resumes the next process in the queue, ensuring fair CPU allocation.
- **Key Metrics**:
  - **Arrival Time**: When a process enters the ready queue.
  - **Burst Time**: Total CPU time required to complete a process.
  - **Time Quantum**: Fixed duration of CPU allocation per process (typically 10-100ms).
  - **Waiting Time**: Time spent in the ready queue (sum of waiting periods minus time before arrival).
  - **Turnaround Time**: Time from arrival to completion (waiting time + burst time).
  - **Response Time**: Time from arrival to first CPU allocation (low due to cyclic execution).
- **Implementation**:
  - Uses a circular queue or linked list to manage processes.
  - Requires a timer interrupt to enforce the time quantum (related to *Processes and Threads* for context switching).
  - Widely used in time-sharing and interactive systems (e.g., Linux, Windows).
- **Context Switching**:
  - Higher overhead than non-preemptive algorithms (e.g., FCFS, non-preemptive SJF, *FCFS Scheduling*, *SJF Scheduling*) due to frequent preemptions, but tunable via quantum size.

### Why Needed
- **Fairness**: Ensures all processes receive CPU time, preventing monopolization by long processes (contrast with *LRTF Scheduling*).
- **Responsiveness**: Low response times make it ideal for interactive and time-sharing systems (e.g., user applications).
- **Multitasking**: Supports concurrent execution of multiple processes, enhancing system utilization (*Processes and Threads*).
- **Simplicity**: Easy to implement with predictable behavior for general-purpose OSs.

### Advantages
- Fair CPU allocation, reducing the **convoy effect** seen in FCFS (*FCFS Scheduling*).
- Low response times, improving user experience in interactive systems.
- Prevents **starvation** (*Starvation and Aging*) as all processes eventually execute.
- Flexible performance via adjustable time quantum.

### Disadvantages
- **Context Switching Overhead**: Frequent preemptions increase overhead, especially with small time quanta (*Processes and Threads*).
- **Suboptimal Throughput**: Higher average waiting and turnaround times compared to SJF/SRTF (*SJF Scheduling*, *SRTF Scheduling*).
- **Time Quantum Sensitivity**: 
  - Too small: Excessive context switches reduce efficiency.
  - Too large: Degenerates to FCFS, increasing waiting times (*FCFS Scheduling*).
- **Not Real-Time Friendly**: Lacks priority or deadline awareness, unsuitable for RTOS (*Real-Time Operating System*).

### Technical Notes
- **Relation to Prior Discussions**:
  - **Processes/Threads** (*Processes and Threads*): RR schedules processes or threads, with frequent context switches impacting performance.
  - **Starvation and Aging** (*Starvation and Aging*): RR avoids starvation by cycling through all processes, unlike Priority or LRTF (*Priority Scheduling*, *LRTF Scheduling*).
  - **FCFS/SJF/SRTF/LRTF/Priority Scheduling** (*FCFS Scheduling*, *SJF Scheduling*, *SRTF Scheduling*, *LRTF Scheduling*, *Priority Scheduling*):
    - Unlike FCFS (arrival-based), SJF/SRTF (burst-based), LRTF (longest burst-based), or Priority (priority-based), RR uses time slicing for fairness.
    - Less optimal than SJF/SRTF for throughput but better for responsiveness.
  - **Spooling** (*Spooling*): RR’s cyclic approach is analogous to fair I/O job processing in spool queues.
  - **Deadlocks** (*Deadlock*): RR does not directly cause deadlocks but can delay processes waiting for resources (*Semaphore and Mutex*).
  - **Virtual Memory/Paging** (*Virtual Memory, Paging, Demand Paging*): RR may contribute to **thrashing** (*Thrashing*) if many processes overload RAM (*Main Memory and Secondary Memory*).
  - **Fragmentation** (*Fragmentation*): Indirectly related, as frequent process execution may increase memory contention.
  - **Belady’s Anomaly** (*Belady’s Anomaly*): Not directly related, but poor memory management can increase page faults.
  - **Real-Time Operating System** (*Real-Time Operating System*): RR is unsuitable for RTOS due to lack of deadline guarantees.
  - **Dynamic Binding** (*Dynamic Binding*): RR ensures fair CPU allocation for dynamically loaded processes.
- **Time Quantum Tuning**:
  - Small quantum (e.g., 1ms): Improves responsiveness but increases context-switching overhead.
  - Large quantum (e.g., 100ms): Reduces overhead but approaches FCFS behavior.
  - Optimal quantum depends on workload (e.g., 10-20ms for interactive systems).
- **Performance Metrics**:
  - Average Waiting Time: Sum of waiting times divided by number of processes.
  - Average Turnaround Time: Sum of turnaround times divided by number of processes.
  - Example: Processes P1 (burst 24ms, arrive 0ms), P2 (burst 3ms, arrive 1ms), P3 (burst 3ms, arrive 2ms), quantum = 4ms:
    - Timeline: P1 (0-4ms), P2 (4-7ms), P3 (7-10ms), P1 (10-14ms), P1 (14-18ms), P1 (18-22ms), P1 (22-24ms).
    - Waiting: P1=6ms, P2=3ms, P3=5ms; Average = (6+3+5)/3 = 4.67ms.
    - Turnaround: P1=24ms, P2=6ms, P3=8ms; Average = (24+6+8)/3 = 12.67ms.
- **Implementation**:
  - Linux: RR is used within the Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) for real-time tasks (SCHED_RR policy).
  - Windows: Employs RR for threads within the same priority level in its scheduler.
  - Common in time-sharing systems (e.g., UNIX variants).
- **Modern Context**:
  - In 2025, RR remains relevant for interactive systems (e.g., desktops, servers) and cloud environments (e.g., container scheduling in Kubernetes).
  - Used in hybrid schedulers with priority or fairness adjustments (e.g., Linux CFS).

### Example
- Three processes: P1 (burst 24ms, arrive 0ms), P2 (burst 3ms, arrive 1ms), P3 (burst 3ms, arrive 2ms), quantum = 4ms.
  - **RR Timeline**:
    - 0-4ms: P1 (20ms remains).
    - 4-7ms: P2 (0ms remains, completes).
    - 7-10ms: P3 (0ms remains, completes).
    - 10-14ms: P1 (16ms remains).
    - 14-18ms: P1 (12ms remains).
    - 18-22ms: P1 (8ms remains).
    - 22-24ms: P1 (6ms remains, completes).
  - Waiting: P1=6ms (10-4+14-10+18-14+22-18), P2=3ms (4-1), P3=5ms (7-2); Average = (6+3+5)/3 = 4.67ms.
  - Turnaround: P1=24ms, P2=6ms, P3=8ms; Average = (24+6+8)/3 = 12.67ms.
  - Note: Fair allocation reduces waiting for short jobs compared to FCFS (*FCFS Scheduling*).
