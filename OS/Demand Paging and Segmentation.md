# Demand Paging and Segmentation in Operating Systems

## 1. Demand Paging

### Definition
Demand paging is a virtual memory management technique where pages are loaded into physical memory (RAM) only when they are accessed by a process, rather than preloading the entire process. It optimizes memory usage by deferring page loading until necessary.

### Technical Characteristics
- **Mechanism** (refer to *Paging* and *Virtual Memory* for related details):
  - Pages are stored in secondary storage (e.g., swap space on disk or SSD) until a process references them.
  - A **page fault** occurs when a process accesses a page not in RAM, triggering the OS to:
    1. Locate the page in swap space.
    2. Allocate a free page frame in RAM (evicting another page if necessary, using algorithms like LRU, discussed in *Belady’s Anomaly*).
    3. Load the page into the frame and update the page table.
  - **Valid-Invalid Bit**: Page table entries mark pages as valid (in RAM) or invalid (in swap), guiding fault handling.
- **Components**:
  - **Page Table**: Maps virtual pages to physical frames or swap space (discussed in *Paging*).
  - **Swap Space**: Reserved disk area for pages not in RAM (discussed in *Virtual Memory*).
  - **TLB**: Caches page table entries for fast address translation (discussed in *Paging*).
- **Types of Page Faults**:
  - **Minor (Soft)**: Page is in memory but not mapped (e.g., shared library page).
  - **Major (Hard)**: Page must be loaded from disk, causing I/O delay.
  - **Invalid**: Access to an illegal address, causing process termination (e.g., segmentation fault).

### Why Needed
- **Memory Efficiency**: Loads only required pages, reducing RAM usage compared to loading entire processes.
- **Supports Multitasking**: Allows more processes to run concurrently by minimizing memory footprint (discussed in *Processes and Threads*).
- **Enables Large Applications**: Processes can exceed physical RAM using swap space (discussed in *Virtual Memory*).
- **Reduces Startup Time**: Processes start faster by loading only initial pages, deferring others.

### Advantages
- Saves memory by loading pages on demand.
- Supports large programs and multitasking.
- Reduces process startup latency.

### Disadvantages
- Page faults increase I/O, risking **thrashing** if frequent (discussed in *Thrashing*).
- Disk I/O latency slows execution during faults.
- Overhead in managing page faults and swap space.

### Technical Notes
- **Relation to Prior Discussions**:
  - **Virtual Memory** (*Virtual Memory*): Demand paging is a core feature, enabling lazy loading.
  - **Paging** (*Paging*): Builds on paging by loading pages only when needed.
  - **Thrashing** (*Thrashing*): Excessive faults from demand paging can cause thrashing.
  - **Belady’s Anomaly** (*Belady’s Anomaly*): Poor page replacement (e.g., FIFO) in demand paging can increase faults.
  - **Fragmentation** (*Fragmentation*): Demand paging uses fixed-size pages, avoiding external fragmentation but risking internal fragmentation.
  - **Processes/Threads** (*Processes and Threads*): Supports process isolation and efficient memory use.
- **Implementation**:
  - Linux: Uses demand paging for executables and shared libraries (e.g., `mmap` system call).
  - Windows: Implements demand paging for process memory and DLLs.
- **Performance**:
  - SSDs reduce fault latency compared to HDDs.
  - Prefetching (loading pages likely to be needed) mitigates faults but risks wasting memory.
- **Example**: A process starts with only its code page loaded. Accessing a data page triggers a fault, loading it from swap, allowing execution to continue.

## 2. Segmentation

### Definition
Segmentation is a memory management technique that divides a process’s virtual address space into variable-sized segments based on logical units (e.g., code, data, stack), each with its own base address and length. It provides a user-oriented view of memory, unlike the fixed-size blocks of paging.

### Technical Characteristics
- **Mechanism**:
  - **Segments**: Logical divisions of a process’s memory (e.g., main program, functions, stack, heap).
  - **Segment Table**: Per-process table mapping segment numbers to physical base addresses and lengths.
  - **Address Translation**: A virtual address consists of a segment number and offset. The OS:
    1. Looks up the segment in the segment table.
    2. Checks if the offset is within the segment’s length.
    3. Computes the physical address (base + offset).
  - **Protection**: Segment table entries include access permissions (e.g., read, write, execute).
- **Components**:
  - **Segment Table**: Stores base address, length, and permissions for each segment.
  - **MMU**: Translates segment-based virtual addresses to physical addresses.
- **Implementation**:
  - Used in older systems (e.g., Multics, early UNIX) or combined with paging (e.g., x86 architecture).
  - Modern OSs (e.g., Linux, Windows) primarily use paging but support segmentation in limited contexts (e.g., x86 segment registers).

### Why Needed
- **Logical Organization**: Segments align with program structure (e.g., code vs. data), simplifying development and debugging.
- **Flexible Allocation**: Variable-sized segments match logical units, reducing wasted memory compared to fixed partitions.
- **Protection and Sharing**: Segments can have distinct permissions, enabling fine-grained access control and sharing (e.g., shared code segments).
- **Supports Modular Programming**: Facilitates separate compilation and linking of program modules.

### Advantages
- Logical memory division improves program clarity.
- Supports sharing and protection at the segment level.
- Flexible allocation for variable-sized memory needs.

### Disadvantages
- **External Fragmentation**: Variable-sized segments create non-contiguous free memory gaps (discussed in *Fragmentation*).
- **Complex Management**: Segment tables and address translation are more complex than paging.
- **Limited Use**: Largely replaced by paging in modern OSs due to fragmentation and overhead.
- **Risk of Thrashing**: If combined with demand loading, frequent segment faults can increase I/O (discussed in *Thrashing*).

### Technical Notes
- **Relation to Prior Discussions**:
  - **Virtual Memory** (*Virtual Memory*): Segmentation is an alternative or complement to paging, supporting virtual address spaces.
  - **Paging** (*Paging*): Unlike paging’s fixed pages, segmentation uses variable-sized units, risking external fragmentation.
  - **Fragmentation** (*Fragmentation*): Segmentation causes external fragmentation, unlike paging’s internal fragmentation.
  - **Thrashing** (*Thrashing*): Demand-loaded segments can contribute to thrashing if memory is insufficient.
  - **Processes/Threads** (*Processes and Threads*): Segmentation supports process isolation and modular memory allocation.
  - **Deadlocks/Starvation** (*Deadlock and Starvation*): Resource contention for segments can lead to starvation if not managed fairly.
- **Paged Segmentation**:
  - Modern systems combine segmentation and paging (e.g., x86): Segments are divided into pages, reducing fragmentation but increasing complexity.
  - Example: Linux uses paging primarily, with segmentation limited to legacy support (e.g., FS/GS registers).
- **Performance**:
  - Segmentation is slower than paging due to variable-sized allocation and fragmentation management.
  - Compaction (relocating segments) mitigates fragmentation but adds overhead.
- **Example**: A process has segments for code (10KB), data (5KB), and stack (2KB). The segment table maps these to physical memory, but deallocation creates fragmented gaps, unlike paging’s fixed blocks.
