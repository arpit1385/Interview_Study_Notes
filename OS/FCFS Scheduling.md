# First-Come, First-Serve (FCFS) Scheduling

## Definition
First-Come, First-Serve (FCFS) Scheduling is a non-preemptive CPU scheduling algorithm in operating systems where processes are executed in the order they arrive in the ready queue. It is also known as First-In, First-Out (FIFO) scheduling.

### Technical Characteristics
- **Mechanism**:
  - Processes are queued in the ready queue based on their arrival time.
  - The CPU executes the process at the head of the queue until it completes or blocks (e.g., for I/O, discussed in *Spooling*).
  - Once a process starts, it runs to completion without interruption, as FCFS is non-preemptive.
- **Key Metrics**:
  - **Arrival Time**: When a process enters the ready queue.
  - **Burst Time**: CPU time required by a process to complete.
  - **Waiting Time**: Time a process spends in the ready queue (sum of burst times of prior processes minus arrival time).
  - **Turnaround Time**: Total time from arrival to completion (waiting time + burst time).
  - **Response Time**: Equal to waiting time, as processes start only after prior ones finish.
- **Implementation**:
  - Simple queue data structure (e.g., FIFO queue) managed by the OS scheduler.
  - Used in batch operating systems (discussed in *Process Types*) or as a baseline in modern OSs (e.g., Linux, Windows).
- **Context Switching**:
  - Minimal, as FCFS is non-preemptive; occurs only when a process completes or blocks (related to *Processes and Threads*).

### Why Needed
- **Simplicity**: Easy to implement and understand, suitable for systems with predictable workloads.
- **Fairness in Order**: Ensures processes are served in arrival order, avoiding complex priority decisions.
- **Batch Processing**: Effective in early batch systems where jobs were processed sequentially (related to *Spooling*).

### Advantages
- Simple and low overhead, requiring minimal scheduler complexity.
- Fair for processes arriving early, ensuring FIFO order.
- No starvation for high-priority processes, as all processes eventually run (contrast with *Starvation and Aging*).

### Disadvantages
- **Convoy Effect**: Short processes wait behind long processes, increasing average waiting and turnaround times.
  - Example: A 100ms process waits for a 10s process, delaying execution.
- Poor performance for interactive systems due to high response times.
- Inefficient for multitasking, as it lacks preemption (contrast with *Real-Time Operating System*).
- Susceptible to **starvation** (*Starvation and Aging*) in dynamic environments if new processes keep arriving.
- Not suitable for real-time systems, as it ignores deadlines (*Real-Time Operating System*).

### Technical Notes
- **Relation to Prior Discussions**:
  - **Processes/Threads** (*Processes and Threads*): FCFS schedules processes or threads in the ready queue, impacting CPU allocation.
  - **Starvation and Aging** (*Starvation and Aging*): FCFS avoids starvation if no new processes arrive but can cause delays for later arrivals, mitigated by aging.
  - **Spooling** (*Spooling*): FCFS is analogous to FIFO queuing in print spooling, managing I/O jobs in arrival order.
  - **Deadlocks** (*Deadlock*): FCFS does not directly cause deadlocks but can delay processes waiting for resources (*Semaphore and Mutex*).
  - **Virtual Memory/Paging** (*Virtual Memory, Paging, Demand Paging*): FCFS scheduling may exacerbate **thrashing** (*Thrashing*) if memory-intensive processes run sequentially, overloading RAM (*Main Memory and Secondary Memory*).
  - **Fragmentation** (*Fragmentation*): Indirectly related, as long-running processes may increase memory contention.
  - **Belady’s Anomaly** (*Belady’s Anomaly*): FCFS page replacement (FIFO) can exhibit the anomaly, though distinct from CPU scheduling.
  - **Real-Time Operating System** (*Real-Time Operating System*): FCFS is unsuitable for RTOS due to lack of priority or deadline awareness.
  - **Dynamic Binding** (*Dynamic Binding*): FCFS scheduling may delay dynamically loaded processes, impacting runtime binding.
- **Performance Metrics**:
  - Average Waiting Time: Sum of waiting times divided by number of processes.
  - Average Turnaround Time: Sum of turnaround times divided by number of processes.
  - Example: Processes P1 (burst 10ms, arrive 0ms), P2 (burst 5ms, arrive 1ms), P3 (burst 2ms, arrive 2ms):
    - Waiting: P1=0ms, P2=9ms, P3=14ms; Average = (0+9+14)/3 = 7.67ms.
    - Turnaround: P1=10ms, P2=14ms, P3=16ms; Average = (10+14+16)/3 = 13.33ms.
- **Implementation**:
  - Linux: Rarely used alone; may be combined with other algorithms (e.g., CFS).
  - Windows: Used in batch scenarios or as a fallback in legacy systems.
- **Modern Context**:
  - FCFS is less common in 2025 interactive systems (e.g., cloud, IoT) but serves as a baseline for comparison with advanced schedulers (e.g., Completely Fair Scheduler).
  - Still relevant in simple embedded systems or batch processing environments.

### Example
- Three processes: P1 (burst 24ms, arrive 0ms), P2 (burst 3ms, arrive 1ms), P3 (burst 3ms, arrive 2ms).
  - FCFS Order: P1 → P2 → P3.
  - Timeline: P1 (0-24ms), P2 (24-27ms), P3 (27-30ms).
  - Waiting Times: P1=0ms, P2=23ms, P3=25ms; Average = (0+23+25)/3 = 16ms.
  - Turnaround Times: P1=24ms, P2=26ms, P3=28ms; Average = (24+26+28)/3 = 26ms.
  - Issue: P2 and P3 wait excessively due to P1’s long burst (convoy effect).
