# Priority Scheduling

## Definition
Priority Scheduling is a CPU scheduling algorithm in operating systems that assigns each process a priority value and selects the process with the highest priority from the ready queue for execution. It can be implemented as **non-preemptive** (the process runs to completion or blocks) or **preemptive** (a higher-priority process can preempt the running process).

### Technical Characteristics
- **Mechanism**:
  - Each process is assigned a priority (e.g., integer value, where lower or higher values indicate higher priority, depending on the system).
  - **Non-Preemptive**: The highest-priority process in the ready queue is executed until it completes or blocks (e.g., for I/O, discussed in *Spooling*).
  - **Preemptive**: If a new process with a higher priority arrives, the current process is preempted, and the higher-priority process is allocated the CPU.
  - The scheduler maintains a priority queue, sorted by priority, with arrival time or process ID as a tiebreaker.
- **Key Metrics**:
  - **Arrival Time**: When a process enters the ready queue.
  - **Burst Time**: CPU time required to complete a process.
  - **Priority**: A value determining execution order (e.g., 1 = highest, 10 = lowest).
  - **Waiting Time**: Time spent in the ready queue (depends on higher-priority processes).
  - **Turnaround Time**: Time from arrival to completion (waiting time + burst time).
  - **Response Time**: Time from arrival to first CPU allocation (lower in preemptive mode).
- **Implementation**:
  - Requires a priority queue or sorted list to manage processes by priority.
  - Priority can be static (fixed at process creation) or dynamic (adjusted, e.g., via aging, discussed in *Starvation and Aging*).
  - Used in modern OSs (e.g., Linux, Windows) and real-time systems (*Real-Time Operating System*).
- **Context Switching**:
  - Non-preemptive: Minimal, only on completion or blocking (related to *Processes and Threads*).
  - Preemptive: Higher, due to preemptions when higher-priority processes arrive.

### Why Needed
- **Prioritize Critical Tasks**: Ensures high-priority processes (e.g., system tasks, real-time jobs) execute first, critical for RTOS (*Real-Time Operating System*).
- **Flexibility**: Supports diverse workloads by assigning priorities based on importance, deadlines, or resource needs.
- **Real-Time Systems**: Guarantees timely execution of time-sensitive tasks (e.g., automotive control systems).
- **User Experience**: Enhances responsiveness for interactive or foreground processes in multitasking systems.

### Advantages
- Ensures high-priority tasks execute promptly, improving system responsiveness.
- Supports real-time and critical applications with strict timing requirements.
- Flexible with static or dynamic priority adjustments (e.g., via aging, *Starvation and Aging*).
- Reduces delays for important processes compared to FCFS (*FCFS Scheduling*).

### Disadvantages
- **Starvation Risk**: Low-priority processes may be indefinitely delayed if high-priority processes keep arriving, causing **starvation** (*Starvation and Aging*).
- **Complexity**: Requires priority management and sorting, increasing scheduler overhead.
- **Priority Inversion**: A low-priority process holding a resource can delay a high-priority process, mitigated by priority inheritance (*Semaphore and Mutex*).
- **Poor for Equal Priorities**: Degenerates to FCFS if many processes have the same priority (*FCFS Scheduling*).
- **Not Optimal for Throughput**: May increase average waiting times compared to SJF/SRTF (*SJF Scheduling*, *SRTF Scheduling*).

### Technical Notes
- **Relation to Prior Discussions**:
  - **Processes/Threads** (*Processes and Threads*): Priority scheduling manages processes or threads, impacting CPU allocation and context switching.
  - **Starvation and Aging** (*Starvation and Aging*): Starvation of low-priority processes is a major issue, mitigated by aging to incrementally boost priority.
  - **FCFS/SJF/SRTF/LRTF Scheduling** (*FCFS Scheduling*, *SJF Scheduling*, *SRTF Scheduling*, *LRTF Scheduling*):
    - Unlike FCFS (arrival-based), SJF/SRTF (burst-based), or LRTF (longest burst-based), priority scheduling uses a user- or system-defined priority.
    - May resemble SRTF if priority is based on burst time but is more general.
  - **Spooling** (*Spooling*): Similar to prioritizing critical print jobs in spool queues.
  - **Deadlocks** (*Deadlock*): Can delay processes waiting for resources, contributing to **hold and wait** conditions (*Semaphore and Mutex*).
  - **Virtual Memory/Paging** (*Virtual Memory, Paging, Demand Paging*): Delaying low-priority processes may exacerbate **thrashing** (*Thrashing*) if they are memory-intensive (*Main Memory and Secondary Memory*).
  - **Fragmentation** (*Fragmentation*): Indirectly related, as delayed processes may increase memory contention.
  - **Belady’s Anomaly** (*Belady’s Anomaly*): Not directly related, but poor memory management can increase page faults.
  - **Real-Time Operating System** (*Real-Time Operating System*): Widely used in RTOS (e.g., RMS, EDF) to meet deadlines.
  - **Dynamic Binding** (*Dynamic Binding*): May delay dynamically loaded low-priority processes, affecting runtime binding.
- **Priority Assignment**:
  - Static: Fixed at process creation (e.g., system vs. user processes).
  - Dynamic: Adjusted based on behavior, waiting time, or system state (e.g., Linux `nice` values, Windows thread priorities).
- **Performance Metrics**:
  - Average Waiting Time: Sum of waiting times divided by number of processes.
  - Average Turnaround Time: Sum of turnaround times divided by number of processes.
  - Example (Preemptive, lower number = higher priority): Processes P1 (burst 10ms, priority 3, arrive 0ms), P2 (burst 1ms, priority 1, arrive 1ms), P3 (burst 2ms, priority 4, arrive 2ms), P4 (burst 1ms, priority 2, arrive 3ms):
    - Timeline: P1 (0-1ms), P2 (1-2ms), P4 (2-3ms), P1 (3-12ms), P3 (12-14ms).
    - Waiting: P2=0ms, P4=0ms, P1=2ms, P3=10ms; Average = (0+0+2+10)/4 = 3ms.
    - Turnaround: P2=1ms, P4=1ms, P1=12ms, P3=12ms; Average = (1+1+12+12)/4 = 6.5ms.
- **Implementation**:
  - Linux: Uses priority-based scheduling in CFS with `nice` values (-20 to +19, lower = higher priority).
  - Windows: Employs thread priorities (0-31, higher = higher priority) in its scheduler.
  - RTOS: Common in hard/soft real-time systems with RMS or EDF (*Real-Time Operating System*).
- **Modern Context**:
  - In 2025, priority scheduling is integral to RTOS (e.g., QNX, VxWorks) and modern OSs (e.g., Linux PREEMPT_RT for real-time tasks).
  - Used in cloud systems to prioritize critical workloads (e.g., Kubernetes pod priorities).

### Example
- Four processes: P1 (burst 10ms, priority 3, arrive 0ms), P2 (burst 4ms, priority 1, arrive 1ms), P3 (burst 2ms, priority 4, arrive 2ms), P4 (burst 1ms, priority 2, arrive 3ms) (lower number = higher priority).
  - **Preemptive Priority Timeline**:
    - 0-1ms: P1 (priority 3).
    - 1-5ms: P2 (priority 1, preempts P1).
    - 5-6ms: P4 (priority 2, preempts P1 after P2 completes).
    - 6-15ms: P1 (priority 3, resumes after P4).
    - 15-17ms: P3 (priority 4).
  - Waiting: P2=0ms, P4=2ms, P1=5ms, P3=13ms; Average = (0+2+5+13)/4 = 5ms.
  - Turnaround: P2=4ms, P4=3ms, P1=15ms, P3=15ms; Average = (4+3+15+15)/4 = 9.25ms.
  - Note: P3 (lowest priority) waits longest, risking starvation.
